- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Shvoruk, a second-year software engineering student specializing in backend development.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in not being replaced by AI.
- ðŸ˜  Passionate about everything that my hands touch.
- âš¡ Fun fact: There's an esoteric programming language called Brainfuck that uses only eight simple commandsâ€”yet it's Turing complete. This means that, in theory, Brainfuck can compute anything any other programming language can, despite its incredibly minimal syntax designed purely as a challenge for programmers.
